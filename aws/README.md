# AWS deployment scripts

Here you can find scripts for different deployment scenarios using AWS platform. 
The deployment instructions are available on the official website (see links below):

- [**monolith**](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/install/cluster/aws-monolith-setup/) - simplistic deployment of ThingsBoard monolith 
with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.

with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Amazon MSK 
and ElastiCache for Valkey. Recommended for **scalable and highly available** deployments.
