# AWS deployment scripts

Here you can find scripts for different deployment scenarios using AWS platform. 
The deployment instructions are available on the official website (see links below):

- [**monolith**](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/install/cluster/aws-monolith-setup/) - simplistic deployment of ThingsBoard monolith 
with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. 
Recommended for deployment scenarios that may sacrifice high availability to **optimize the cost**. 
- [**microservices**](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/install/cluster/aws-microservices-setup/) - deployment of ThingsBoard microservices 
with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL, Amazon MSK 
and ElastiCache for Redis. Recommended for **scalable and highly available** deployments.
