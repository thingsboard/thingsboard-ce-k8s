# Kubernetes resources configuration for ThingsBoard Microservices

This folder containing scripts and Kubernetes resources configurations to run ThingsBoard in Microservices mode.

## Prerequisites

ThingsBoard Microservices are running on Kubernetes cluster.
You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster.
If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/minikube), 
[OpenShift](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-install-openshift-origin-on-ubuntu-18-04/),
or you can choose any other available [Kubernetes cluster deployment solutions](https://unofficial-kubernetes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup/pick-right-solution/).

### Minikube Configuration

#### Enable ingress addon 
By default ingress addon is disabled in the Minikube, and available only in cluster providers.
To enable ingress, please execute the following command:

`
$ minikube addons enable ingress
` 

### OpenShift Configuration

#### Create project 
On the first start-up you should create the `thingsboard` project.
To create it, please execute next command:

`
$ oc new-project thingsboard
` 

**NOTE**: Make sure your `kubectl` tool is using the correct cluster context.
You can see all kubectl context and set the correct one using commands:

```
$ kubectl config get-contexts
$ kubectl config use-context THINGSBOARD_CONTEXT
```

Where `THINGSBOARD_CONTEXT` will be something like `thingsboard/SERVER_IP:SERVER_PORT/USER`.

## Installation

Before performing initial installation you can configure the type of database to be used with ThingsBoard and the type of deployment.
In order to set database type change the value of `DATABASE` variable in `.env` file to one of the following:

- `postgres` - use PostgreSQL database;
- `hybrid` - use PostgreSQL for entities database and Cassandra for timeseries database;

**NOTE**: According to the database type corresponding kubernetes resources will be deployed (see `basic/postgres.yml` or `high-availability/postgres-ha.yaml` for postgres with replication, `common/cassandra.yml` for details).

If you selected `cassandra` as `DATABASE` you can also configure the number of Cassandra nodes (`StatefulSet.spec.replicas` property in `common/cassandra.yml` config file) and the `CASSANDRA_REPLICATION_FACTOR` in `.env` file. 
It is recommended to have 3 Cassandra nodes with `CASSANDRA_REPLICATION_FACTOR` equal to 1.

**NOTE**: If you want to configure `CASSANDRA_REPLICATION_FACTOR` please read Cassandra documentation first.  

In order to set deployment type change the value of `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` variable in `.env` file to one of the following:

- `basic` - start up with single instance of Zookeeper, Kafka and Redis;
- `high-availability` - start up with Zookeeper, Kafka and Redis in cluster modes;

**NOTE**: According to the deployment type corresponding kubernetes resources will be deployed (see the content of the directories `basic` and `high-availability` for details).

Also, to run PostgreSQL in `high-availability` deployment mode you'll need to  [install](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) `helm`.

Execute the following command to run the installation:

`
$ ./k8s-install-tb.sh --loadDemo
`

Where:

- `--loadDemo` - optional argument. Whether to load additional demo data.

## Running

Execute the following command to deploy third-party resources:

`
$ ./k8s-deploy-thirdparty.sh
`

Type **'yes'** when prompted, if you are running ThingsBoard in `high-availability` `DEPLOYMENT_TYPE` for the first time or if you don't have configured Redis cluster.

Before deploying ThingsBoard resources you can configure number of pods for each service in `common/thingsboard.yml` by changing `spec.replicas` fields for different services. 
It is recommended to have at least 2 `tb-node` and 10 `tb-js-executor`.
Execute the following command to deploy resources:

`
$ ./k8s-deploy-resources.sh
`

After a while when all resources will be successfully started you can open `http://{your-cluster-ip}` in your browser (for ex. `http://192.168.99.101`).
You should see the ThingsBoard login page.

**NOTE**: If you're using OpenShift cluster you can view all Routes in Web GUI under Applications/Routes menu (main route by default starts with `tb-route-node-root-thingsboard`).

Use the following default credentials:

- **System Administrator**: sysadmin@thingsboard.org / sysadmin

If you installed DataBase with demo data (using `--loadDemo` flag) you can also use the following credentials:

- **Tenant Administrator**: tenant@thingsboard.org / tenant
- **Customer User**: customer@thingsboard.org / customer

In case of any issues, you can examine service logs for errors.
For example to see ThingsBoard node logs execute the following commands:

1) Get the list of the running tb-node pods:

`
$ kubectl get pods -l app=tb-node
`

2) Fetch logs of the tb-node pod:

`
$ kubectl logs -f [tb-node-pod-name]
`

Where:

- `tb-node-pod-name` - tb-node pod name obtained from the list of the running tb-node pods.

Or use `kubectl get pods` to see the state of all the pods.
Or use `kubectl get services` to see the state of all the services.
Or use `kubectl get deployments` to see the state of all the deployments.
See [kubectl Cheat Sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) command reference for details.

Execute the following command to delete all ThingsBoard microservices:

`
$ ./k8s-delete-resources.sh
`

Execute the following command to delete all third-party microservices:

`
$ ./k8s-delete-thirdparty.sh
`

Execute the following command to delete all resources (including database):

`
$ ./k8s-delete-all.sh
`

## Upgrading

In case when database upgrade is needed, execute the following commands:

```
$ ./k8s-delete-resources.sh
$ ./k8s-upgrade-tb.sh --fromVersion=[FROM_VERSION]
$ ./k8s-deploy-resources.sh
```

Where:

- `FROM_VERSION` - from which version upgrade should be started. See [Upgrade Instructions](https://thingsboard.io/docs/user-guide/install/upgrade-instructions) for valid `fromVersion` values.
